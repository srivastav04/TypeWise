⌨️ TypeWise — Typing Practice Web App
TypeWise is a visually engaging and responsive typing practice website built for desktop users. Designed to enhance your typing speed and accuracy, it features smooth animations, a clean UI, and real-time feedback—all built from the ground up using the MERN stack.

This side project was a fun opportunity to deepen my full-stack development skills, experiment with frontend animations, and create an interactive experience that’s both functional and aesthetic.

⚠️ Note: TypeWise is optimized for desktop. Mobile support is limited for now.
